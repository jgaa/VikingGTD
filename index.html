        <h3>Action / Tasklist manager</h3>

<p>Inspired by the <strong>great</strong> book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362907996&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=getting+things+done">Getting Things Done</a> by David Allan. This is a program I wrote because I badly needed it in order to organize my own time. I failed to find anything, on any platform, that satisfied my requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Preferably Open Source</li>
<li>Designed after the principles in "Getting Things Done"</li>
<li>Safe; no unnecessary app privileges, no enforced integration with Google (or any other) services in order to work.</li>
<li>Fast and efficient to work with</li>
<li>Safeguards against losing data by accidents in stressful environments (for example by canceling a half edited task by hitting the Android back button).</li>
<li>Professionally designed and implemented (I'm just too tired with amateurish implemented "apps").</li>
</ul><p>These requirements became my blueprint when I built VikingGTD. And unlike the majority of today’s "app" writers, I am a professional software developer with more than 25 years of experience in software design and implementation. VikingGTD is free of eye candy and animations – but in stead very fast and responsive, also when the number of tasks grows during real use by busy people.</p>

<p>The current version is optimized for large handsets like the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note II. A tablet enabled version is in the works and will be released soon. Synchronization between devices will also be released soon. Since I'm using the app myself to organize most aspects of my work and my life, I'm rapidly implementing new features.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ol>
<li>Any number of actions in one of any number of lists.</li>
<li>Each action can be configured with when, where, how and at what priority. These parameters can then be used to easily sort trough and re-organize the actions.</li>
<li>Search in lists and actions.</li>
<li>Fast access to main functions and frequently used features</li>
<li>Easy to schedule an action to any time, date, week, month, or year. </li>
<li>Easy and fast to reschedule one or more activities</li>
<li>No built in limitations, no nagging about money, no ads.</li>
<li>No <em>phone home</em>, sneaking in private data or other misbehavior.</li>
<li>Import data from the TaskList app if you already use that to organize your life.</li>
<li>Export and import the data to/from xml for backup and transfer to other devices.</li>
</ol><p>Released under GPLv3.</p>
